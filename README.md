# SpeakUp

## Introduction
SpeakUp is a web application designed to promote active citizenship through facilitating the process of reading, understanding, and voting on legislation. Users can browse various bills, summaries of those bills, and cast their vote, all while engaging in a discussion with other users in the community.
