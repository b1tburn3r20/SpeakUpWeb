# SpeakUp

## Introduction
SpeakUp is a web application created to enhance democratic transparency and foster active citizenship. It directly addresses the challenge of understanding complex legislative language that often obscures the true impact of laws being passed. 

By transforming lengthy, verbose legislative documents into comprehensible summaries, SpeakUp enables users to easily read, understand, and vote on various bills. The aim is to empower every citizen to partake in their democracy, removing the barrier of legal jargon and fostering open and accessible dialogue on issues that matter.

With SpeakUp, governmental decisions are no longer hidden within pages of convoluted documentation. Users can browse, comprehend, and interact with actual bills, engaging in the democratic process in a way that's accessible, transparent, and impactful.

## Unsolved Problems
1. Complex bills still require manual summarization for easy understanding.
2. Real-time vote update feature still to be implemented.
  

## Future Enhancements
1. Incorporation of a feature that automates the summarization of complex bills.
2. Implementation of a real-time vote count update system.
3. Creation of a notification system for users to get updates on bills they've voted or commented on.
